// variables are declared with "let" or "var"
// btw. this is a comment - with comments I can explain my code to remember later, what the code does
let lastname=""; // this is a variable of datatype string
let firstname="";
let height=0; // in cm - this is a variable from datatype int
let weight=0; // in kg
let isFemale=true; // this is a variable of datatype boolean - it is true if you are female

console.log("Hello " + firstname + " " + lastname);
console.log("I know some things about you!");
console.log("You are " + height + " cm tall.");
console.log("Your weight is " + weight + " kg.");
