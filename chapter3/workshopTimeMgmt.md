# Time Management Workshop

## Opening 
* personal stories in the field of time mgmt by the mentors
    * if you can manage your person next step is to manage a team
    * huge ambition -> no chaos allowed -> resource planing (finance, time)
* goal of today: 
    * give you the tools for time mgmt
* what is your expectations?

## Mindsweeping
* Task (2 min): write down every task you have on the mind until the mind is empty
* Background: 
  * allow the mind to be creative
  * WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN (when it comes to your mind)
* Task (7 min)
    * mindsweeping (continue)
    * music in the background
* Tools
    * You decide, e.g. paper, google keep or `todo.txt` + Dropbox

## Mind mapping 
* Tool to organize any subject.
* Get the big picture
* Start in the middle, sub-subjects are circular around the main topic
* Center: my life (grow mushrooms from here):
    * Subtopics: codecool, workpace, hobby, sport, family, friends, ...
    * Common thing in all the areas is that they all have to do you must do to reach your goal. But it allows you to focus.
    * Tasks are in imperative mode
* Draw your mindmap. Use a different sheet of paper. Work alone.
* Questions:
    * Who wrote a new tasks?
    * Who identified a new area?

## Further techniques 
* (Google) Calendar:
    * Use colors
    * Short, clear names (just like in programming)
    * put only thing with exact date and time in the calendar
    * Save slots for important tasks
* 2min rule - don't write whatever takes less then 2 minutes but do it now.
* Prioritization. Eisenhower Matrix:
```
                URGENT      NOT URGENT 
IMPORTANT       do          schedule
NOT IMPORTANT   delegate    discard
```
* Feeling Overwhelmed: Pomodoro (25m work + 5m break). After 4 pomodoros longer break.
* Learn to say "no". It's OK to say "I thought about it and it doesn't feel right". So I changed my mind. Or learn to say "give me time to contemplate it".
* Matrix (for activities):
```
    Introduce | Increase
    Reduce    | Stop
```
* SMART goals
    * specific
    * measurable
    * achievable
    * relevant
    * time-bound (time boxing)

## Introspection 
* Your mind-map subtopics represent what's important for you: 
    * Take 3 most important ones.
    * Add sleep, eating, commuting
    * Write them down in the order of importance for you
    * Write next to them how many hours would you like to spend ideally on them per week
    * Write next to it how many hours did you spend on them last week. Compare
* Time Thieves
    * What are yours? Examples:
        * Internet, Video games
        * TV, Music
        * Hanging around aimlessly
        * Going out
        * Cleaning clean things
        * Social Network / Internet / CellPhone
    * Be vigilant!

## Week organizing 
* "project management for one person"
    * Calendar
        * insert all events
    * Establish free time for work for the week
    * Backlog (todo.txt) grooming:
        * put in the order of importance
        * assign estimated time
        * Establish which tasks you can tackle that week
    * Create a Kanban board for the week
      *  TODO -> DOING -> DONE
    * Hints:
        * Be realistic (past will teach you)
        * Factor in time for regeneration etc.
        * Have some buffer
