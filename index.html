                    you would describe yourself. You would define properties like, name, height, weight, gender and so on. In this project you have
                    some variables given with predefined values.

                    <b>Your task:</b> First run the code and see what is printed on the console. Change the content of the variables so they describe you and run your code again.

                    <b>Hint:</b> <mark>console.log()</mark> is a function. We will learn later what functions are. Important for you for now is to know, that this function prints anything
                    you "tell" it (what you pass in the round brackets) to the screen.

                    the percentage the student achieved on an exam. The percentage is evaluated by coincidence every time you start the script again.
                     You need to verify which mark the student receievd.
