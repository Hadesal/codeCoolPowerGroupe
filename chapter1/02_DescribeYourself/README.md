# Describe yourself

Just imagine you would describe yourself. You would define properties like, name, height, weight, gender and so on. In this project you have some variables given with predefined values.


## What are you going to learn?

* How to use variables

## Tasks

### Run it
Run the code and see what is printed on the console.

### Express yourself
Change the content of the variables so they describe you and run your code again.

### More about you
Declare further variables which describe you best

## Hints
`console.log()` is a function. We will learn later what functions are. Important for you for now is to know, that this function prints anything you "tell" it (what you pass in the round brackets) to the screen.
