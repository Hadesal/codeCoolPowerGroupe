# Loop Master

TO become a true master in using loops you need to face them in different situations.

## What are you going to learn?

* Write different loops
* Use different loops for different problems

## Tasks

### Log numbers
Write a loop to display the numbers 1-10.

### Sum of a serie
Write a loop to calculate the sum of the numbers 1-10 and display the result.

### Only odds
Write a loop to display the first 10 odd numbers

### Factorial
Write a loop to multiply the numbers 1-10 and display the result.

### 3x+1
Write a loop that displays you all numbers in the 3x+1 series of the number 1111 (so first 1111 is printed, then 3332 is printed, then 1666, ...)

### Broooooooam
Create an array of cars. The cars are objects and they have the properties: brand, price, horsepower, color and year_of_construction. Create following cars there: BMW(70000, 200hp, white, 2020), Mazda(45000, 220hp, silver, 2021), Volvo(55000, 190hp, beige, 2021), Opel(38000, 155hp, black, 2021), Mazda(22000, 90hp, magenta, 2021), Fiat(19000, 110hp, blue, 2019)

Create a loop which filters all cars which cost less than 60000 (means print all properties).
Create a loop which filters all cars which have more than 150 hp.
Create a loop which will print all cars that are made after 2020 and have less than 100 hp.
Create a loop which will print all cars that are by Fiat or have less than 150 hp.

## Hints
* A number is odd if the number % 2 equals 1 (1%2=1, 3%2=1,5%2=1, ... but 2%2=0, 4%2=0...).
