# Loop Master

To become a true master in using loops you need to face them in different situations.

## What are you going to learn?

* Write different loops
* Use different loops for different problems

## Tasks

### Log numbers
Write a loop to display the numbers `1-10`.

### Sum of a series
Write a loop to calculate the sum of the numbers `1-10` and display the result.

### Only odds
Write a loop to display the first `10` odd numbers

### Factorial
Write a loop to multiply the numbers `1-10` and display the result.

### 3x+1
<<<<<<< HEAD
Write a loop that displays you all numbers in the 3x+1 series of the number 1111 (so first 1111 is printed, then 3332 is printed, then 1666, ...). Look at the background materials for more information.

### Broooooooam
* Create an array of cars. The cars are objects and they have the properties: brand, price, horsepower, color and year_of_construction. Create following cars there: 
    * `BMW(70000, 200hp, white, 2020)`
    * `Mazda(45000, 220hp, silver, 2021)`
    * `Volvo(55000, 190hp, beige, 2021)`
    * `Opel(38000, 155hp, black, 2021)`
    * `Mazda(22000, 90hp, magenta, 2021)`
    * `Fiat(19000, 110hp, blue, 2019)`
* Create a loop which filters all cars which cost less than `60000` (means print all properties).
* Create a loop which filters all cars which have more than `150 hp`.
* Create a loop which will print all cars that are made after `2020` and have less than `100 hp`.
* Create a loop which will print all cars that are by `Fiat` or have less than `150 hp`.

## Hints
* A number is odd if the `number % 2` equals 1 (`1 % 2 == 1`, `3 % 2 == 1`,`5 % 2 == 1`, ... but `2 % 2 == 0`, `4 % 2 == 0`...).
