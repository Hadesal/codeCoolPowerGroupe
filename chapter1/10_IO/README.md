# Simple Akinator

Write a script that can guess a figure the user is thinking about

## What are you going to learn?

* Read from the console
* Write to the console
* Repeating already learned concepts

## Tasks

### Ask the user
Implement questions which the user has to answer with "yes" or "no". If the user answers with something else, then tell him, that he needs to limit his answer to "yes" and "no".

### Finally log your result
If you are sure which figure the user thinks about then you can ask the user if you are guessing correctly. E.g. "Is the figure you are thinking about ... ?". If the user answers with yes, you won.

## Hints
* The questions should help you finding the right properties of your objects - e.g. Is the figure you are thinking about grey? -- if yes then you can limit the amount of figures to a few and ask further about them.
* If you had fun with this task you might add more figures and try to extend your script :)
