# Evaluate students marks

Imagine you are writing a program which evaluates which mark a student gets, depending on the percentage the student achieved on an exam. The percentage is evaluated by coincidence every time you start the script again. You need to verify which mark the student received.

## What are you going to learn?

* How to use conditions.

## Tasks

### Tell the good news
If the percentage is above or equal 50%, make a log that the student passed the exam, otherwise tell the student that he did not pass.

### Tell the mark
Extend the program now so that it evaluates that if a student got more than or equal 90%, the student got a "1". If the student received between 70% and 89%, the mark is a "2", between 65%-79% it is a "4", between 50% and 64% it is a "4" and else a "5". Make a log to the student which mark he received and how many percent.


## Hints
Do not look too much to the random generator function. Important for you is only that the variable percentage is a number between 0 and 100.
