# Mixed Fruits

We would like to create some colorful fruits. You have given a collection of colors and a collections of fruits.

## What are you going to learn?

* How to use arrays.

## Tasks

### Create the fruits
Fill all collections with values and see which fruits are created.

### Log it
Log the length of all collections and each element of each collection.

### Nested Loops
Log the combination of all fruits and colors.


## Hints
* We created a random function to generate random indices to access values of collections randomly to make you some appetite for more :)
* For the combination of all fruits and colors you need nested loops (this means a loop in a loop)
