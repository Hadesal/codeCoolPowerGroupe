# Introduction To JavaScript - General lookup

Welcome to your first week pair of the ProgBasics module. In the `Readme.md` file you will find all projects in the order which we would strongly recommend to follow.

Really try to make all projects, since the more is missing now, the more difficult it is going to be later.

Further you can find here a good collection of some links and explanations for javascript topics. These links and topics are pretend to be look ups. Start with the projects and whenever you would like to have more detailed information about a topic you might come back here and check the material attached in the `Background Material` section.

Good Luck!
